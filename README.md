# OpenGL 3D Game Tutorial

This code is based on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix/about>ThinMatrix<a> OpenGL 3D Game tutorial series. The difference is that this is written in <a href=https://www.khronos.org/opengles/>OpenGL ES<a> in <a href=https://developer.android.com/studio/>Android Studio<a>. This makes it  run on all android devices which has SDK 18 or higher.
